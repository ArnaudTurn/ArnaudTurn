### Hi there welcome on [ArnaudTurn](https://github.com/ArnaudTurn/) gitpage !


👋 I'm Arnaud, welcome to my Github page. You will find few projects mainly related to data science topics.



💎 I'm found of scaling machine learning projects and building frameworks reusable through multiple topics implying structured and unstructured data. On top of that I am really interested in the use of ML projects up to a user experience using complementary knowledge (devops, database administration, front-end developement, [librairies](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Design thinking, ...).



🔐 I do not share all of my personal projects but will always be happy discussing breakthrough and bondaries of data science related topics.

### Who ? What ?

🔍 I've been a data scientists for 3 years in the banking industry working on financial, risks and marketing use cases (financial product recommender, anti-money laundering detector, fraud detector and many more ...) using Python language mainly (with some SQL let's be honest and a bit of HTML/.js when needed), [machine](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [deep learning](https://keras.io/) frameworks leveraging for some with data sciences platform tools.



🤩 I also worked quite a lot on the assessment of the data science platform tools and am really interested in the market of data vizualization, data science, data ops as well as the products.
