### Hi [there](![ClippyMicrosoftGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35238149/145718912-a628c247-14af-43cf-a155-cb9d3527c7e5.gif)) !

👋 I'm Arnaud, welcome to my Github page. You will find few projects mainly related to data science topics.

💎 I'm found of scaling machine learning projects and building frameworks reusable through multiple topics implying structured and unstructured data. On top of that I am really interested in the use of ML project up to an user experience using complementary knowledge (devops, database administration, front-end developement, [librairies](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Design thinking, ...).

🔐 I do not share all of my personal projects but will always be happy discussing breakthrough and bondaries of data science related topics.

### What I did so far ?

🔍 I've been a data scientists for 3 years in the banking industry working on financial, risks and marketing use cases (financial product recommender, anti-money laundering detector, fraud detector and many more ...) using Python language mainly (with some SQL let's be honest and a bit of HTML/.js when needed), [machine](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [deep learning](https://keras.io/) frameworks leveraging for some with data sciences platform tools.

I also worked quite a lot on the assessment of the data science platform tools and really interested in the motion going into this market.
