## Hi there and welcome !

<br />

👋 I'm Arnaud, welcome to my Github page. You will find few old yet simple projects mainly related to data science topics

💎 I'm found of scaling machine learning projects and building frameworks reusable through multiple topics implying structured and unstructured data. On top of that I am really interested in the use of ML projects up to a user experience using complementary knowledge (devops, database administration, front-end developement, [librairies](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Design thinking, ...).

🔐 I do not share my personal projects but will be happy discussing breakthrough and boundaries of data science and algorithmic trading related topics.

<br />

### Who ? What ? 

🔍 I've been a data scientists for 4 years in the banking industry working on financial, risks and marketing use cases (financial product recommender, anti-money laundering detector, fraud detector and many more ...) using Python language mainly (SQL as well and a bit of HTML/.js when needed), [machine](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [deep learning](https://keras.io/) frameworks leveraging for some with data sciences platform tools.

🤩 I also worked on the assessment of data science platform tools and am really interested in new technologies, new algorithms and data/ml ops.

<br />

### My play ground
✈️ Algorithms & Automation

🥅 Solving problems with optimized ML techniques on Unstructured/structured data (financial data, scrapped based, ...)

🤖 Competitions (internal / external) 

🆕 New tech and ideas
